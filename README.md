# Overview

This is a Reddit clone created to showcase my ability and knowledge in developing a social news and discussion platform using specific technologies. While it may not be as large or complex as the original Reddit, the platform still offers the ability for users to submit links, images, and text posts on various topics. Users can upvote or downvote posts and comments, and the platform includes various subreddits for more targeted discussions. Additionally, users can create their own subreddits and moderate them. My goal is to create a platform that demonstrates my capabilities as a developer while providing users with a space to connect, share ideas, and engage in thoughtful discussions.



# Features

- User registration and login
- Ability for users to submit links, images, and text posts on various topics
- Voting system for posts and comments (upvoting and downvoting)
- Various subreddits for more targeted discussions
- User-created subreddits with moderation capabilities
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

# Getting Started

1. Navigate to the deployed website
2. Register a new account or log in to an existing account
3. Start browsing and engaging with content on the platform!
4. Join existing communities by browsing through the subreddit list and clicking on the ones that interest you. Once you've joined a community, you can start engaging with other users and content by posting your own content, commenting on others' posts, and upvoting or downvoting content that you like or dislike.
5. Create your own community by clicking on the dropdown arrow on the navbar and selecting "Create Community" from the list of options. From there, you can choose a name and description for your community, set rules, and start inviting other users to join.

# Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to add several new features and improvements to this Reddit clone, including:

- **Messaging:** Adding the ability for users to message each other directly through the platform
- **Polling:** Including a feature that allows for creating and taking polls within posts on communities
- **Video Posts:** Allowing users to submit video posts in addition to links, images, and text
- **User Profile Page:** Creating a user profile page that includes all the functionalities of a Reddit profile page, such as the ability to view and manage posts, comments, and messages, as well as customizable settings and preferences.

I'm committed to continually improving and expanding this platform, and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future.
